# Kits
The Kits repository is for user-made kits.
Kits are to contain assets from only mods we use.
Files must be as follows.

1. File names must be pre-fixed by type of server, Ops, Ops Lite, etc
2. Files names should have a description of some sort.
3. Files names must be appended by the submitter's name
4. Files must have all comments removed from them. 
5. Files should always be in .txt or .md format.

File names should look like the following:
Lite-CTRG-JTAC-Konigstiger.txt
Ops-VDV-ENGY-Konigstiger.md

Users can submit kits easily using Github.
